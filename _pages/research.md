## Current Research

**PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning** (2025-2029)
*Imperial College London | [Mathematics for Future Climate CDT](https://www.mfccdt.ac.uk/)*

My research focuses on uncertainty quantification and extrapolation in machine learning weather prediction systems. My work includes developing methods to improve the reliability and interpretability of MLWP models, particularly when making predictions outside their training distribution.

## Recent Work

**MSc Statistics Thesis**
[*"Approximate Bayesian Computation with Proper Scoring Rules: An Inference Framework for Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasts"*](/MSc_Thesis.pdf/)

This report develops a framework combining ABC methods with proper scoring rules to improve probabilistic forecast calibration.
