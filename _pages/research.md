## Current Research

**PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning** (2025-2029)
*Imperial College London | [Mathematics for Future Climate CDT](https://www.mfccdt.ac.uk/)*

My research focuses on generative modelling, extreme value theory and uncertainty quantification with applications in machine learning weather prediction systems. My work includes developing methods to improve the reliability and interpretability of generative models, particularly when sampling outside their training distribution.
