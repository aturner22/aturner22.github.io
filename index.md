Background in statistics, machine learning, climate science and finance, with experience spanning both academic research and business applications.

I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London researching statistics and machine learning applied to weather prediction systems as part of the [Mathematics for Future Climate CDT](https://mfccdt.ac.uk/). My research theme covers uncertainty quantification, extrapolation and extremes for MLWP, with a current focus on principled latent space representations of the atmosphere. 

My professional experience includes data engineering and research roles in the financial sector, with particular expertise in forecasting, LLM implementation and unstructured data extraction. I'm available for [technical consulting](/technical_consulting/) on data-driven projects.

Recent achievements include being awarded first place in the [OpenWeather Challenge 2025](https://challenge.openweather.co.uk/) for my submission [WIRE](https://wire-delta.vercel.app/), as well as wins in two [Society for Technological Advancement](https://ilikethefuture.com/) hackathons, where I developed an automated Bayesian prior elicitation system for non-technical experts and an AI geoengineering simulator based on machine learning weather models.

My previous studies include a BA in Economics and Management at the University of Oxford and an MSc in Statistics at Imperial College London.

Beyond work and academia, I'm a saxophonist who writes music and regularly performs across London. I also enjoy hiking, travelling and generally exploring nature!
